## OTIS
I was also an [OTIS](https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html) instructor for a few years. However, I no longer tutor students â€” teaching is fun, but time-consuming. I still recommend OTIS to any high school students trying to improve at math olympiads (but you should know that having a tutor is neither necessary nor sufficient to do well, and I think the practice you do when no one is around to teach you is far more important).

## More
More things coming soon&trade; (once I get around to updating this website again)

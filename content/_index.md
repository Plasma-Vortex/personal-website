Welcome to my (newly revamped!) website :wave:

I'm Howard, a math contest enthusiast, hobbyist programmer, and avid learner of anything that piques my curiosity. I'm currently an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University.

In the past, I participated in tons of high school math contests. I was drawn to these competitions because of how fun they were (if you haven't seen math contest problems before, you should give them a try! They're nothing like the standard textbook questions you see in school). Later I was motivated by a desire to see just how far I could go. The result: a spot on Canada's 2018 and 2019 [International Math Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=28475) teams, earning two silver medals. Even though it's been years since then, I'll always be a math competitor at heart.

Now I'm at Carnegie Mellon studying computer science. Some areas of CS I like learning about are:
- Theoretical CS
- Graphics
- Machine Learning
- Web Development
- PL Theory
- Computer Systems
- Human-Computer Interaction
- and... wait, that's most of the [CS concentrations offered at CMU](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/scsconcentrations/)! (but I really do think all these topics are interesting. I could write a non-CS list as well, which would be even longer)

But something I enjoy even more is building new things â€” especially coding up [side projects](/projects/) in my free time (which I need to actively make time for, otherwise my schedule fills up with other things). I try to pick projects which expand my skill set, are interesting to me, and are useful for others.
